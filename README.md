### number-guesser

A game where the user inputs a guess between 1-100 and the computer compares the user guess to the random generated number. If guess is
too high or too low the computer will send a message and will also tell them when they've guessed correctly. When user guesses correctly
the range on the min and max increase by 10 numbers. 

The user is also able to adjust the range that they'd like to guess between, making it more difficult or easy for themselves.
I also incorporated a scoring feature that adds 10 points if they guess correctly within 3 tries, get 5 points for guessing between 
4-7 tries and only 2 points for 5+ guesses.
